# Using CS2 With Your Own Data

This virtual machine is pre-configured with a demonstration corpus of CTS texts and CITE collections. This document describes the steps necessary to replace the default dataset with a custom dataset.

## Overview

To implement a custom CS2, we will do the following:

- Configure Cite-Archive-Manager to build a new dataset.
- Load the new dataset into a separate Fuseki endpoint.
- Install a second copy of the CS2 servlet, named CS2custom.
- Change some default settings in CS2custom.
- Make sure it works.

## Building New Data
